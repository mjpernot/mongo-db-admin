# Python project for administration of a Mongo database.
# Classification (U)

# Description:
  This is used to adminstrate a Mongo database, to include repairing and defragmentating databases and defragmenting and validating tables.


###  This README file is broken down into the following sections:
  * Features
  * Prerequisites
    - FIPS Environment
  * Installation
  * Configuration
  * Program Help Function
  * Testing
    - Unit


# Features
  * Repair Mongo databases.
  * Validate tables in a Mongo database.
  * Defragment a Mongo database or table.
  * Display current status of a Mongo database server.
  * Check for errors in the Mongo log that is stored in memory cache.

# Prerequisites:

  * List of Linux packages that need to be installed on the server.
    - Centos 7 (Running Python 2.7):
      -> python-pip
      -> python-devel
    - Redhat 8 (Running Python 3.6):
      -> python3-pip
      -> python3-devel
      -> gcc

  * FIPS Environment:  If operating in a FIPS 104-2 environment, this package will require at least a minimum of pymongo==3.8.0 or better.  It will also require a manual change to the auth.py module in the pymongo package.  See below for changes to auth.py.
    - Locate the auth.py file python installed packages on the system in the pymongo package directory.
    - Edit the file and locate the \_password_digest function.
    - In the \_password_digest function there is an line that should match: "md5hash = hashlib.md5()".  Change it to "md5hash = hashlib.md5(usedforsecurity=False)".
    - Lastly, it will require the configuration file entry auth_mech to be set to: SCRAM-SHA-1 or SCRAM-SHA-256.


# Installation:

# Configuration:

Create Mongodb configuration file.  Make the appropriate change to the environment.
  * Make the appropriate changes to connect to a Mongo database.
    - user = "USER"
    - japd = "PSWORD"
    - host = "HOST_IP"
    - name = "HOSTNAME"

  * Change these entries only if required:
    - port = 27017
    - conf_file = None
    - auth = True
    - auth_db = "admin"
    - auth_mech = "SCRAM-SHA-1"

  * Notes for auth_mech configuration entry:
    - NOTE 1:  SCRAM-SHA-256 only works for Mongodb 4.0 and better.
    - NOTE 2:  FIPS 140-2 environment requires SCRAM-SHA-1 or SCRAM-SHA-256.
    - NOTE 3:  MONGODB-CR is not supported in Mongodb 4.0 and better.

  * If connecting to a Mongo replica set.  By default set to None to represent not connecting to replica set.
    - repset = "REPLICA_SET_NAME"
    - repset_hosts = "HOST_1:PORT, HOST_2:PORT, ..."
    - db_auth = "AUTHENTICATION_DATABASE"

  * If Mongo is set to use TLS or SSL connections, then one or more of the following entries will need to be completed to connect using TLS or SSL protocols.  Note:  Read the configuration file to determine which entries will need to be set.
    - SSL:
        -> auth_type = None
        -> ssl_client_ca = None
        -> ssl_client_key = None
        -> ssl_client_cert = None
        -> ssl_client_phrase = None
    - TLS:
        -> auth_type = None
        -> tls_ca_certs = None
        -> tls_certkey = None
        -> tls_certkey_phrase = None

  * FIPS Environment for Mongo:  If operating in a FIPS 104-2 environment, this package will require at least a minimum of pymongo==3.8.0 or better.  It will also require a manual change to the auth.py module in the pymongo package.  See below for changes to auth.py.
    - Locate the auth.py file python installed packages on the system in the pymongo package directory.
    - Edit the file and locate the "_password_digest" function.
    - In the "\_password_digest" function there is an line that should match: "md5hash = hashlib.md5()".  Change it to "md5hash = hashlib.md5(usedforsecurity=False)".
    - Lastly, it will require the Mongo configuration file entry auth_mech to be set to: SCRAM-SHA-1 or SCRAM-SHA-256.

  * List of databases to ignore.
    NOTE: The default list of databases are the system databases (admin, config, local) and should be skipped for some options.
    - ign_dbs = ["admin", "config", "local"]

```
cd config
cp mongo.py.TEMPLATE mongo.py
vim mongo.py
chmod 600 mongo.py
```

If inserting the results into a different Mongo database then create another mongo configuration file and use this file with the -m option.

Create Mongodb configuration file.  Make the appropriate change to the environment.
  * Make the appropriate changes to connect to a Mongo database.
    - user = "USER"
    - japd = "PSWORD"
    - host = "HOST_IP"
    - name = "HOSTNAME"

  * Change these entries only if required:
    - port = 27017
    - conf_file = None

    - repset_hosts = "HOST_1:PORT, HOST_2:PORT, ..."
    - db_auth = "AUTHENTICATION_DATABASE"

  * If using SSL connections then set one or more of the following entries.  This will automatically enable SSL connections. Below are the configuration settings for SSL connections.  See configuration file for details on each entry:
    - ssl_client_ca = None
    - ssl_client_key = None
    - ssl_client_cert = None
    - ssl_client_phrase = None
